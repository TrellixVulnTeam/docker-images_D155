/use the solver
To use the solver just copy IUT_BMB_SAT and minisat binary files from Binary folder to a same folder and then run IUT_BMB_SAT

/run the solver
IUT_BMB_SAT get 2 pathes in command line. The first one is the cnf File path and the second one is the temporary directory path. This 2 pathes are mandatory. No other inputs need for this solver.

For example
IUT_BMB_SAT /root/hanoi4.cnf /tmp
The first path = cnf file path =/root/hanoi4.cnf
The Second path = temporary directory = /tmp

/build the binary files from sources
for making minisat binary file just make the makefile in /Source/minisat/simp
for making IUT_BMB_SAT binary file just compile the /Source/IUT_BMB_SAT/New_Factoring.cpp with gcc like
g++ -o IUT_BMB_SAT ../Source/IUT_BMB_SAT/New_Factoring.cpp

Comments Dear Organizers:

The make file that I will submit works fine on the severs I use. When running this solver, two options are needed: the first one is the name of the instance file and the second one is a random seed. If there is any problem with the make file and options, please let me know. Thanks!
